### Matrix Multiplication Algorithms

    This repository contains the implementation of different matrix multiplication algorithms and their performance analysis.

    Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra that involves multiplying two matrices to produce a third matrix. The problem of matrix multiplication is to find an efficient algorithm to compute the product of two matrices. The straightforward algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^3), which is not efficient for large matrices. Therefore, researchers have developed various algorithms to improve the efficiency of matrix multiplication.

## Description of Algorithms
    # Strassen's and Winograd's Algorithms
    Strassen's and Winograd's algorithms are two of the most popular algorithms for matrix multiplication. Both algorithms are based on the divide-and-conquer approach. Strassen's algorithm is a recursive algorithm that divides the matrices into submatrices of size n/2 x n/2. The algorithm then recursively multiplies the submatrices to produce the final result. The time complexity of Strassen's algorithm is O(n^2.807). Winograd's algorithm is also a recursive algorithm that divides the matrices into submatrices of size n/2 x n/2. The algorithm then recursively multiplies the submatrices to produce the final result. The time complexity of Winograd's algorithm is O(n^2.75).
